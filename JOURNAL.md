# August 5: Start, eyeballing, display, mcu
I'll probably be using a Xiao Rp2040 and one of those1.8  inch adafruit TFTs(same as the original sprig, grounded is giving these out)
After some estimation, slack threads, physical measurement, and 3d models, I think that the xiao will fit under the TFT if the TFT sits on standard headers(Sprig uses 5MM tall headers, but I'll likely have to use standard height headers)

Sorry for less then ideal detailed log, I'm kind rushing rn sorry.
